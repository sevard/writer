        For all extras: 
            uv pip compile pyproject.toml --all-extras

    To upgrade dependencies while compiling, use:
        For a specific package: 
            uv pip compile - -o requirements.txt --upgrade-package ruff
        To upgrade all dependencies: 
            uv pip compile - -o requirements.txt --upgrade

Syncing the Environment
After creating the requirements.txt, you can sync your environment with:
    uv pip sync requirements.txt

This command ensures that your environment matches the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
